# POO_radiography
C++ project with Julien Paris (Master 2 Bioinformatics for Biologists - University of Nantes, FRANCE) 

Goal : create an interface allowing to manage files and to track what is happening in a radiology center (Users are practicians) using POO in Cpp. 

Problem that you could face if you're trying it : most parts are in French... 

Important note : We created a fake dataset to see if our codes were working or not, where names could be whatever the names you want. 
                 And so, all information contained in the Centre_Radio folder are false.
